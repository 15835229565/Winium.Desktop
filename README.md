Winium.Desktop is Selenium Remote WebDriver implementation for automated testing of Windows application based on WinFroms and WPF platforms.

## Supported Platforms
- WinForms
- WPF

For Windows Phone 8.1 test automation tool see [Windows Phone Driver](https://github.com/2gis/Winium.StoreApps).
For Windows Phone 8 Silverlight test automation tool see [Windows Phone Driver](https://github.com/2gis/winphonedriver).

## Why Winium?
You have Selenium WebDriver for testing of web apps, Appium for testing of iOS and Android apps. And now you have Selenium-based tools for testing of Windows apps too. What are some of the benefits? As said by Appium:
> - You can write tests with your favorite dev tools using any WebDriver-compatible language such as Java, Objective-C, JavaScript with Node.js (in promise, callback or generator flavors), PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, Clojure, or Perl with the Selenium WebDriver API and language-specific client libraries.
> - You can use any testing framework.
